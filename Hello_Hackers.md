## Introduction to Commands

The first challenge was about using my first command.So basically 
I needed to use the hello command (with hello being different from
Hello) and it gave me the flag.Like in the example by using whoami
command it was printing the username.


## Introduction to Arguements

This challenge is just an extension of the previous challenge only
as in the previous one we needed to just give the command 'hello'
,here we actually need to give an arguement 'hackers' with the 
command 'hello'.Like in the example 'echo' command was used 
with the arguement 'Hello' to print Hello.
